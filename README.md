### How to play it

In the beginning, you are locked in a dark room full of alleys. You have to find the door and get your way out.
<br/>
You can either try to find the door directly without light source or walk around and find the light source first to get a better view.
<br/>
Always be aware of that there is a monster wandering around the room and try to catch you.
<br/>
Now you can go and have fun!
